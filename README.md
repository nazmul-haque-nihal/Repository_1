üöÄ Speed_up Keylogger: A Cybersecurity Learning Experience
 
Welcome to the Speed_up Keylogger project, a cutting-edge exploration into the mechanics of keylogging for educational purposes only. Designed for cybersecurity enthusiasts, researchers, and learners, this tool showcases the inner workings of keystroke logging in a controlled, ethical environment. Dive into the future of digital forensics and understand how to protect systems from such tools.

üåå Project Overview
The Speed_up Keylogger is a Python-based demonstration tool that captures keystrokes and clipboard data, sending logs to a Telegram bot for analysis. Built with security and education in mind, it‚Äôs a hands-on way to study keylogging techniques and develop countermeasures.
Key Features:

Real-Time Logging: Captures keystrokes and clipboard content with precision.
Telegram Integration: Sends logs to a secure Telegram bot on Enter key press.
Self-Cleaning: Deletes logs and configuration files on Shift+Esc or system shutdown.
Discreet Operation: Runs silently with .pyw extension, minimizing visibility.


‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Disclaimer: This project is strictly for educational purposes. Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical, violating privacy laws in most jurisdictions. Use this tool only in controlled, consensual environments (e.g., your own device or with explicit permission). The author is not responsible for misuse. Ensure compliance with all applicable laws.


üîí Accessing the Code
The keylogger files are stored in a password-protected Speed_up.rar file hosted on Google Drive with restricted access. Only authorized users with the link and password can access it.
Steps to Access:

Request Access:

Contact the repository owner (@nazmul-haque-nihal) to request access to the Google Drive link.
Provide your email address for restricted sharing.


Download the File:

Access the Google Drive link: Speed_up.rar (Replace with your actual Google Drive link).
Sign in with an authorized Google account or verify your identity via PIN (for non-Google accounts).


Extract the RAR:

Use a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip to extract Speed_up.rar.
Enter the password provided by the repository owner via a secure channel (e.g., Signal).


Set Up the Environment:

The RAR contains Speed_up.pyw and setup_env.py.
Run setup_env.py to generate an .env file for Telegram configuration:python setup_env.py


Edit .env with your own Telegram bot token and chat ID.


Run the Keylogger:

Execute Speed_up.pyw:pythonw Speed_up.pyw


Type text, press Enter to send logs to Telegram, and Shift+Esc to stop and clean up.




üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Python: 3.11 or 3.12 (avoid 3.13 due to potential compatibility issues).
Dependencies (installed automatically by Speed_up.pyw):
requests
pynput
pyperclip
python-dotenv


Telegram Bot: Create a bot via BotFather and obtain a TELEGRAM_TOKEN and CHAT_ID.

Install dependencies manually if needed:
pip install requests pynput pyperclip python-dotenv


üîê Security Notes

Password Protection: The Speed_up.rar file is password-protected to prevent unauthorized access. Contact the owner for the password.
Sensitive Data: Do not include your .env file in shared directories. Use .gitignore to exclude:.env
keylogger.log


Ethical Use: Only run the keylogger on devices you own or have explicit permission to monitor. Unauthorized use is illegal.
Cleanup: The script deletes keylogger.log and .env on Shift+Esc or system shutdown to minimize traces.


üåê Why This Project?
In a world driven by digital innovation, understanding tools like keyloggers is crucial for building robust cybersecurity defenses. This project empowers you to:

Learn how keyloggers operate in a safe, controlled environment.
Develop detection and prevention strategies.
Explore the intersection of code, privacy, and ethics.


üöß Troubleshooting

Logs Not Sending?
Check keylogger.log for errors (e.g., invalid Telegram credentials or network issues).
Verify dependencies are installed.
Test Telegram API:curl -X POST https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_token>/sendMessage -d "chat_id=<your_chat_id>&text=Test"




Files Not Deleting?
Ensure the script has write permissions in the directory.
Check keylogger.log for deletion errors.


Compatibility Issues?
Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 instead of 3.13.
Reinstall dependencies if errors persist.
